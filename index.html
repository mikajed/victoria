            <h1>Victoria Falls</h1>
            <p>A World Heritage Site, Victoria Falls is one of the world's greatest natural spectacles and the stuff of legends, romance and myth. 
                Long before the Scottish missionary and explorer Dr. David Livingstone 'discovered' the Falls in 1855, the local Batonga people had named 
                them Mosi-oa-Tunya, 'the smoke that thunders'.</p>

            <h1>Victoria Bridge</h1>
            <p>The Victoria Falls Bridge crosses the Zambezi River just below the Victoria Falls and is built over the Second Gorge of the falls. 
                As the river forms the border between Zimbabwe and Zambia, the bridge links the two countries and has border posts on the approaches 
                to both ends, at the towns of Victoria Falls, Zimbabwe, and Livingstone, Zambia.</p>

            <p>The Zambezi River (also spelled Zambeze and Zambesi) is the fourth-longest river in Africa, the longest east-flowing river in 
                Africa and the largest flowing into the Indian Ocean from Africa. Its drainage basin covers 1,390,000 km2 (540,000 sq mi), slightly 
                less than half of the Nile's. </p>
